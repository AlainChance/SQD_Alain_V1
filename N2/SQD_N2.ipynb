    "“Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a chemistry simulation technique that uses the quantum computer to extract a noisy distribution of possible electronic configurations of a molecule in the form of bitstrings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, it runs an iterative correction entirely on a classical computer to cluster these bitstrings around the correct electron configuration. \n",

    "## Self-consistent configuration recovery procedure\n",
    "The probabilistic self-consistent configuration recovery is an iterative procedure that runs in a loop which comprises the following steps:\n",
    "- Post-process the full set of bitstring samples, using prior knowledge of particle number and the average orbital occupancy calculated on the most recent iteration.\n",
    "- Probabilistically create batches of subsamples from recovered bitstrings.\n",
    "- Project and diagonalize the molecular Hamiltonian over each sampled subspace.\n",
    "- Save the minimum ground state energy found across all batches and update the average orbital occupancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQD workflow\n",
    "The SQD workflow with self-consistent configuration recovery is depicted in the following diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SQD diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd/7fcec2a686bfe115560db20b840cf2b185ae06f6/docs/_static/images/sqd_diagram.png)\n",

    "The wave function is supported in a set of basis states $\\mathcal{S} = \\{|x\\rangle \\}$ whose size does not increase exponentially with the size of the problem. The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian projected into the subspace defined by $\\mathcal{S}$ is defined as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_\\mathcal{S} = P_\\mathcal{S} H  P_\\mathcal{S} \\textrm{ with } P_\\mathcal{S} = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{S}} |x \\rangle \\langle x |;\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$H_\\mathcal{S}$ yields a good approximation to the target eigenstate. The quantum computing device produces samples of the members of $\\mathcal{S}$ only. A quantum circuit prepares the state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ in the quantum device. The Jordan-Wigner encoding is used, hence members of the computational basis represent Fock states (electronic configurations/determinants). The quantum circuit is sampled in the computational basis, yielding the set of noisy configurations $\\tilde{\\mathcal{X}}$. The configurations are represented by bitstrings. The set $\\tilde{\\mathcal{X}}$ is then passed into the classical post-processing block, where the [self-consistent configuration recovery technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jordan-Wigner transformation\n",
    "The diagonal Coulomb evolution gate under the Jordan-Wigner transformation has the unitary:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\exp\\left(-i t \\sum_{\\sigma, \\tau, i, j} Z^{(\\sigma \\tau)}_{ij} n_{\\sigma, i} n_{\\tau, j} / 2\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $n_{\\sigma, i}$ denotes the number operator on orbital $i$ with spin $\\sigma$, $Z^{(\\sigma \\tau)}$ is a real-valued matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gate assumes that qubits are ordered such that the first `norb` qubits correspond to the alpha orbitals and the last `norb` qubits correspond to the beta orbitals. Ref. [class ffsim.qiskit.DiagCoulombEvolutionJW](https://qiskit-community.github.io/ffsim/api/ffsim.qiskit.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Map classical inputs to a quantum problem\n",
    "We perform a CCSD calculation. The [t1 and t2 amplitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupled_cluster#Cluster_operator) from this calculation will be used to initialize the parameters of the `LUCJ` ansatz circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use [ffsim](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ffsim) to create the ansatz circuit. ffsim is a software library for simulating fermionic quantum circuits that conserve particle number and the Z component of spin. This category includes many quantum circuits used for quantum chemistry simulations. By exploiting the symmetries and using specialized algorithms, ffsim can simulate these circuits much faster than a generic quantum circuit simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the number of unpaired electrons, we use either:\n",
    "* the spin-balanced variant of the unitary cluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz, ffsim class [UCJOpSpinBalanced](https://qiskit-community.github.io/ffsim/api/ffsim.html#ffsim.UCJOpSpinBalanced).\n",
    "* the spin-unbalanced variant of the unitary cluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz, ffsim class [UCJOpSpinUnbalanced](https://qiskit-community.github.io/ffsim/api/ffsim.html#ffsim.UCJOpSpinUnbalanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Optimize problem for quantum execution\n",
    "Next, we optimize the circuit for a target hardware. We generate a staged pass manager using the [generate\\_preset\\_pass\\_manager](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler_preset#generate_preset_pass_manager) function from qiskit with the specified `backend` and `initial_layout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We set the `pre_init` stage of the staged pass manager to `ffsim.qiskit.PRE_INIT`. It includes qiskit transpiler passes that decompose gates into orbital rotations and then merges the orbital rotations, resulting in fewer gates in the final circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Execute using Qiskit Primitives\n",
    "There are two options:\n",
    "* Classical simulation by generating random samples drawn from the uniform distribution. See [A case against uniform sampling](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/quantum-diagonalization-algorithms/sqd-overview#32-a-case-against-uniform-sampling).\n",
    "* Simulation on a real QPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Post-process and return result to desired classical format\n",
    "The first iteration of the self-consistent configuration recovery procedure uses the raw samples, after post-selection on symmetries, as input to the diagonalization process to obtain an estimate of the average orbital occupancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent iterations use these occupancies to generate new configurations from raw samples that violate the symmetries (i.e., are incorrect). These configurations are collected and then subsampled to produce batches, which are subsequently used to project the Hamiltonian and compute a ground-state estimate using an eigenstate solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `diagonalize_fermionic_hamiltonian` function defined in [qiskit-addon-sqd/qiskit\\_addon\\_sqd/fermion.py](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd/blob/main/qiskit_addon_sqd/fermion.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver included in the `SQD addon` uses PySCF's implementation of selected CI, specifically [pyscf.fci.selected_ci.kernel_fixed_space](https://pyscf.org/pyscf_api_docs/pyscf.fci.html#pyscf.fci.selected_ci.kernel_fixed_space)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters of the `SQD class` are user-tunable:\n",
    "* `max_iterations`: Limit on the number of configuration recovery iterations.\n",

However in the context of quantum chemistry, chemical accuracy is often approximated as `1 mHa`.
